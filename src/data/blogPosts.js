        <h2>Introduction: The Modern Business Battleground</h2>
        <p>Imagine this: A potential customer hears about your business and wants to learn more. Their first instinct? Google your name. If you don’t have a website, you risk losing that client to a competitor who does. In 2025, a website isn’t a luxury — it’s the foundation of your credibility, your marketing, and your growth.</p>
  
        <h2>1. Credibility and Trust</h2>
        <p>Over 80% of consumers say a business with a website appears more credible than one with only social media. A website signals permanence and trustworthiness. It gives you control over your story, your reviews, and how you present your business to the world. Think of it as your online business card — but with superpowers.</p>
  
        <h2>2. 24/7 Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Unlike a physical storefront, your website works for you around the clock. Clients can discover your services, read testimonials, and even book or contact you at midnight. You’ll never miss a lead due to “closed” hours.</p>
  
        <h2>3. Attract New Customers (Not Just Referrals)</h2>
        <p>Referrals are gold, but new business often starts online. With proper SEO, your site can attract people searching for your services in St. Louis (or anywhere in the US). More than half of all local searches result in a store visit or call within a day.</p>
  
        <h2>4. Full Control of Your Brand</h2>
        <p>Unlike a Facebook page or Google listing, you own your website. You decide how you look, what you say, and how you interact. No risk of being “shut down” by algorithm changes.</p>
  
        <h2>5. Essential for Advertising and Analytics</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Google Ads & Facebook Ads:</b> Send traffic to your own site, not to social networks you don’t control.</li>
          <li><b>Analytics:</b> Learn which pages work, what people want, and how they find you.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>6. FAQs: But What If I’m on Social Media?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Do I still need a website?</b> Yes! Social is a tool, not a substitute. Your website is the hub of your marketing.</li>
          <li><b>Isn’t it expensive?</b> Not anymore. Modern web design is affordable, and the ROI is huge.</li>
          <li><b>What about DIY builders?</b> They’re fine for hobbyists, but a pro site gets results and scales with you.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Conclusion: Start Your Online Journey Today</h2>
        <p>Ready to make your business visible and professional? A website is your digital handshake. <a href="/contact" class="text-blue-600 underline">Book a free consultation</a> and see how easy it is to get started.</p>

      content: `
        <h2>Introduction: More Than Just a Pretty Website</h2>
        <p>Your website is your business’s first impression. But how do you pick the right partner to build it? With dozens of options in St. Louis, the decision can feel overwhelming. This guide will help you cut through the noise and choose an agency that delivers real results.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Look for Local Experience</h2>
        <p>An agency that understands the St. Louis market knows your audience. Check their portfolio for local businesses like yours. Ask for case studies that show increased traffic, leads, or sales.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Check Reviews and References</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Read Google reviews and testimonials</b> — not just the ones on their own site.</li>
          <li><b>Contact past clients</b> and ask about communication, reliability, and ROI.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>3. Ask About Ownership</h2>
        <p>Will you own your site and your domain? (You should!) Avoid agencies that lock you into expensive “monthly” plans just to keep your website online.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Evaluate Support After Launch</h2>
        <p>Good agencies don’t disappear once your site goes live. Ask:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you get free updates or support for a period?</li>
          <li>What’s their response time for issues?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. What’s Included in the Price?</h2>
        <p>Compare apples to apples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is SEO setup included?</li>
          <li>Do you get analytics, backup, and security?</li>
          <li>How many design revisions are allowed?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Transparency & Communication</h2>
        <p>You want a partner who listens and communicates in plain English. If they’re pushy or vague now, imagine what happens when you need urgent changes.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Red Flags to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>“$99 websites” (you get what you pay for)</li>
          <li>No written contract or timeline</li>
          <li>Refusing to show past work</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Take your time, ask lots of questions, and trust your instincts. Need a quote? <a href="/contact" class="text-blue-600 underline">Contact Domi Websites</a> for honest, no-pressure advice.</p>

      content: `
        <h2>Why Local SEO?</h2>
        <p>Over 70% of customers look for businesses “near me” every month. If you’re not showing up in Google Maps and search, you’re missing sales. Local SEO is how small businesses beat the big brands in their neighborhood.</p>
  
        <h2>Step 1: Claim & Optimize Your Google Business Profile</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Fill out all info (hours, address, phone, website, etc.).</li>
          <li>Add quality photos — inside, outside, and of your work!</li>
          <li>Respond to reviews (good or bad) quickly and professionally.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Step 2: Get More Google Reviews</h2>
        <p>Ask every happy client for a review. Make it easy—text them the link right after the job. The more reviews you have (and respond to), the higher you’ll rank.</p>
  
        <h2>Step 3: Consistent NAP Everywhere</h2>
        <p>NAP = Name, Address, Phone. Make sure these are identical on your website, Google profile, Yelp, and anywhere else online. Inconsistent info confuses Google (and clients).</p>
  
        <h2>Step 4: Use Local Keywords</h2>
        <p>Include your city or neighborhood in page titles, headings, and content. Example: “Affordable Plumbing Services in St. Louis”.</p>
  
        <h2>Step 5: Build Local Links</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Get listed in local directories.</li>
          <li>Partner with nearby businesses for backlinks.</li>
          <li>Sponsor local events (and get a mention online).</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Do I need to blog for local SEO?</b> It helps, but Google profile/reviews come first.</li>
          <li><b>How long does it take?</b> You can see results in weeks if you’re consistent!</li>

        <h3>1. Ignoring Mobile Users</h3>
        <p>Over 60% of visitors are on their phones. If your site is hard to read or navigate on mobile, they’ll bounce to a competitor—fast.</p>
        <h3>2. Slow Load Times</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Large images not optimized for web</li>
          <li>Cheap hosting or no CDN</li>
          <li>Too many plugins or scripts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Poor Navigation</h3>
        <p>Keep your menu simple. Use clear calls-to-action like “Book Now” or “Get a Quote”.</p>
        <h3>4. No Clear Contact Info</h3>
        <p>Your phone number and contact form should be easy to find—on every page.</p>
        <h3>5. Not Using Testimonials</h3>
        <p>Reviews and real client stories build instant trust. Add them!</p>
        <h3>6. Outdated Design or Content</h3>
        <p>If your site looks like it’s from 2012, people assume your business is too. Modernize!</p>

        <h2>What is Web Hosting?</h2>
        <p>Your hosting provider is where your website “lives” online. It affects speed, security, uptime, and even SEO. Choosing the wrong host can cost you money and reputation.</p>
        <h3>1. Shared Hosting</h3>
        <p>Cheapest ($5–$15/mo), but you’re sharing resources with hundreds of other sites. Fine for very small sites, but slow and less secure.</p>
        <h3>2. Managed WordPress Hosting</h3>
        <p>We recommend this for most small businesses. Includes backups, updates, and security. Fast and reliable. Examples: Kinsta, WP Engine, SiteGround.</p>
        <h3>3. Cloud Hosting</h3>
        <p>Best for scaling, advanced users, or if you expect lots of traffic. Examples: AWS, Google Cloud. More complex and pricey.</p>
        <h3>4. What to Look For:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Daily backups</li>
          <li>24/7 support</li>
          <li>SSL certificate included</li>
          <li>Fast load times (look for SSD storage)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Hosting is the foundation of your online presence. Invest wisely and you’ll see the benefits in speed, uptime, and peace of mind.</p>

        <h2>Introduction: Mobile Isn’t Optional</h2>
        <p>As of 2025, 60–70% of all website visits come from smartphones. If your site isn’t mobile-friendly, you’re losing leads, sales, and even Google rankings.</p>
        <h3>1. Google Now Indexes “Mobile First”</h3>
        <p>Google ranks your website based on how it looks and performs on phones. If it’s slow or broken on mobile, your search rankings will tank—even for desktop users.</p>
        <h3>2. Better User Experience = More Sales</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to read (no zooming or horizontal scroll)</li>
          <li>Fast loading (under 3 seconds)</li>
          <li>Clickable buttons and forms</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Lower Bounce Rates</h3>
        <p>Users who get frustrated by bad mobile design leave instantly. Happy visitors stick around longer and are more likely to buy or contact you.</p>
        <h2>How to Check If Your Site is Mobile-Friendly</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use Google’s free <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile-Friendly Test</a>.</li>

        <h2>Why Google Reviews Matter</h2>
        <p>Nearly 90% of customers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Google reviews affect your ranking in Maps and local search — and they build instant trust with new clients.</p>
        <h2>1. Just Ask (Every Time!)</h2>
        <p>After a successful project or happy sale, ask for a review. Most people will say yes if you make it easy.</p>
        <h2>2. Make It Easy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Text or email a direct link to your Google review page.</li>
          <li>Use a QR code on receipts, business cards, or at your checkout.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Respond to Every Review</h2>
        <p>Thank each reviewer publicly. It shows you care — and future customers will notice!</p>
        <h2>4. Display Reviews on Your Website</h2>
        <p>Add a testimonials section with real Google reviews to your site (with stars, screenshots, or quotes).</p>
        <h2>5. Incentivize Staff (Not Clients)</h2>
        <p>Never “buy” reviews, but reward your team for getting happy clients to leave them. Consistency is key.</p>
        <h2>Extra: Handle Bad Reviews Like a Pro</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Always reply politely and offer to resolve issues offline.</li>
